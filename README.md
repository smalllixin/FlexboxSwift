#Using facebook css-layout with swift in real

This is a very basic project shows how to use flexbox in swift project.

AND THIS IS WORKING WELL ON REAL PRODUCTION. 

Modified from swiftbox project and more powerful.

* Support Label,Button,Etc.
* Support VirtualNode (Bind view to node is not necessary)
* Support Absolute/Relative Layout
* Support Animation
* Support layout on background thread

For guys suffering from autolayout(Like me. Not only the syntax but also the performance)
